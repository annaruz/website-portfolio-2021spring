  <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However (and this is a big however)</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>
  <!-- <div style='padding-top: 1px'></div> --> <!-- adding this is a way to prevent vertical margins from collapsing
      only consecutive elements can collapse into each other
      putting an element with 1px height forces the paragraphs to both display the 25px top margin and 50px bottom margin-->
  <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements do not.</p>
  <!-- elements like h1 and p are block-level elements; em and strong are inline elements -->
  <div>Button</div>
  <!-- divs and spans are "container" elements that don't have any effect on the semantic structure of an HTML document
    divs are used for block-level content and spans are used for inline content-->
