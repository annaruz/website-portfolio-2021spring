      <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
      <p class='synopsis'>CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.</p>
      <p>Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages.</p>
      <p>We'll also be talking about links in this example, so here's <a href='https://internetingishard.com'>Interneting Is Hard</a> for us to style.</p>
      <a class='button' href='nowhere.html'>Button One</a>
      <a class='button call-to-action' id='button-2' href='nowhere.html'>Button Two</a>
        <!-- can have multiple classes in the same element
        matter of the classes does not matter on the HTML document-->
      <div class='sidebar'>
        <p>If this page had a sidebar...</p>
        <p>We'd have some problems with pseudo-classes.</p>
      </div>
      <a href='#button-2'>Go to Button Two</a>
        <!--we use this to direct users to something with a specific ID sleector on the same page. it changes the fragment of the URL-->
