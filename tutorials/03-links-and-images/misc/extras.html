      <!-- two dots represent a pointer to the parent directory or they wouldn't be able to find the files since they are in a folder above this document
        to go through more directories, use multiple ..s like ../../elsewhere.html-->
    <h2>Character Sets</h2>
    <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>bir</li>
      <li>iki</li>
      <li>üç</li>
      <li>dört</li>
      <li>beş</li>

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
    <!-- entities always start with an & and end with a ; -->
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;webtypography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes a bit.</p>
    <!-- double quotes quotes: &ldquo; and &rldquo;
      single quotes: &lsquo; and &rlquo;
      these hug the text in place of straight quotes -->
