    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>
    <!-- href tells them that the element is a link -->
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Absolute links, like to
        <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
        <!-- absolute links should be used for external sites-->
        <!-- target _blank opens a new tab or window-->
      <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>
        <!-- relative links point to another file in your website; you need to supply the pathway-->
        <!-- slashes represent folders and files-->
      <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
      <!--Root relative links are used when links are relative to the "root" of the website like our-site.com
          don't work with local HTML files-->
    </ul>
