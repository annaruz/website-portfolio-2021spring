# An Honest Review of Every Class I've Taken at Pitt
Hello! I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh, and I am creating this web project for my Composing Digital Media Course writing reviews for all of the classes that I have taken here at Pitt along with a few showcases of my own work that I completed in the courses. The classes that I have taken are divided into four categories: communication, writing, Spanish, and gen eds (general education courses). All of these sites were created with HTML and CSS. This is my first major project using these platforms, and my learning progress is also documented in this repository in the tutorials folder with the tutorials that I completed from [InternetingIsHard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/). While this repository has my current final draft, I still may add more features to it as part of my final project for this class. Enjoy!
