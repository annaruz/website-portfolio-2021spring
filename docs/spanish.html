    <h2>SPAN 0120: Conversation</h2>
    <p>Clearly, there was lots of conversation in this class which was very good for me who had not taken a Spanish class since high school. I interviewed a friend of one of my friends for this class for a conversation with a native Spanish speaker, and the man who spoke with me was a student at Carnegie Mellon. To thank him for doing the interview, I told him that I could get him a snack of drink, and he wanted chocolate milk. I remember running around campus in search of the drink.</p>

    <h2>SPAN 0125: Grammar and Composition</h2>
    <p>This class made me think of my Spanish classes in high school. We wrote a lot; I have <em>many</em> documents in this folder with various short compositions written about Hermione Granger, analyses of articles, and letters to friends. Also, there was lots of in-class conversation which I like a lot. The girl who sat next to me in this class didn't like our professor at all, but I loved her. She wasn't the most organized, but she was funny, caring, and a good teacher!</p>

    <h2>SPAN 1250: Hispanic Civilizations</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>SPAN 1455: Border Studies</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>SPAN 1312: Linguistics</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>SPAN 1459: Mapping the Female Body</h2>
    <p>One of the perks of being in upper level Spanish class is that you get to focus on cultural studies rather than just grammar. For our first class, we read a graphic story about a girl who got her period for the first time. This opened a conversation on perceptions of menstruation in Latin America as well as in the United States. I was immediately interested in the class, and it has not disappointed! We've also covered topics like motherhood, childbirth, breast cancer, and more. </p>
