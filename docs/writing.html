    <h2 class='about'>ENGCMP 0208: Seminar in Service Learning</h2>
    <p>This class was to this day one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Pitt. If you have the chance to take this class, do it, especially if you are passionate about or interested in service work.
      The professor of this course is absolutely incredible. I learned a lot about Pittsburgh and service in this class, and through this class I also got to do weekly service work tutoring students in a
      nearby neighborhood. I recommend finding a buddy that you can go to your service site with each week since you'll most likely have to take a Port Authority bus to get there. I would take this class again in a heartbeat, and I highly recommend it to anyone.</p>

    <h2>ENGWRT 0610: Introduction to Journalistic and Non-Fiction Writing</h2>
    <p>Another one of my absolute favorite Pitt classes. I really grew as a writer during this class because my professor exposed me to new writing styles and challenged me to incorporate them into my own work.
    The first official writing assignment that we completed was based on observation, and I chose to write mine about RedHawk Coffee, my favorite coffee shop in Oakland.</p>

    <h2>ENCMP 0610: Composing Digital Media</h2>
    <p>This class has been one of my favorite classes because it has challenged me creatively more than any other class that I have taken at Pitt. I have learned so many skills that I never thought I would be able to understand like sound editing and photo editing, and now here I am making a webpage!</p>
