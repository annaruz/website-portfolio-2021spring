    <h2>COMMRC 0300: An Introduction to the Communication Process</h2>
    <p>This was the first class that I took at Pitt, and I loved it! It encouraged me to take many other communication classes at Pitt, as you can see, and it provided a great baseline understanding of communication processing which I took through all of the other classes!</p>

    <h2>COMMRC 0310: Rhetorical Process </h2>
    <p>Rhetorical processing was very chill.</p>

    <h2>COMMRC 0320: Mass Communication Process</h2>
    <p>I really liked this class. We learned a lot, and the professor was very fun and told stories very well. My only qualm was that we would get study guides for the exam that had like 300 terms and then the actual test was only like 60 questions. If you're going to take this class, make sure you have a Quizlet account.</p>

    <h2>COMMRC 0520: Public Speaking</h2>
    <p>Public speaking is never a fun class to take, especially when you have to take it over Zoom. As a Pathfinder, I don't mind public speaking, but these classes really depend on the professor you had. My professor did not like me (I still don't know why), so this class was not the best for me.</p>

    <h2>COMMRC 1121: History of Mass Media</h2>
    <p>I learned so much in this class. The professor gives you a perspective of media that you don't often get in other classes looking from a historical perspective because he really highlights the experiences of disenfranchised groups like women and African Americans. He recorded all of his lectures and added fun effects, videos, and songs which was very cute.</p>

    <h2>COMMRC 1732:  Media Relations </h2>
    <p>

    <h2>COMMRC 1111: Theories of Persuasion</h2>
    <p>Very interesting class. Lots of writing, though. You have like three discussion board posts due each week, and they are intense. The professor is very nice.</p>

    <h2>COMMRC 1730: Special Topics in Health Communication</h2>
    <p>As someone continuing my education in public health after this semester, I really love this course. It's all online and it entails lots of reading and writing. I absolutely <strong>love</strong> the textbook that we use for this course because it looks at health in a very holistic way.</p>
