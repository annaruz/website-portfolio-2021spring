<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Media and Professional Communications major in the College of General Studies on the Corporate and Community Relations track. I am also getting a Spanish minor from the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. I started out at Pitt with an undecided major in Dietrich on the pre-med track, but after 2 chemistry classes, I decided pre-med was <em>not</em> for me. <br/>
This project has been really incredible for me to look at how far I have come and how much I have learned in my college career. It's also crazy how much I have forgotten and how long ago some of these classes seem. Just trying to picture each classroom that each of these courses were in was a good mental exercise, especially with distinguishing my Spanish classes. As I'm finishing my last undergraduate classes before entering Pitt's Graduate School of Public Health as part of their Accelerated Master's Program, it is great to look back at the classes that I have taken and how positive most of them were!</p>
