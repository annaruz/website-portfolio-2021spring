    <h2 class='about'>PSY 0010: Introduction to Psychology</h2>
    <p>I can still taste the Einstein's Brothers plain bagel with onion and chive schmear that I would buy after this class. One of the iconic classes of being a first-year at Pitt. This is one of two classes that has over 400 students at Pitt (the other class is History of Jazz which I have not taken). This class gives a great foundational knowledge of some of the basic concepts of psychology. There was also a research requirement for you to be a participant in a research study which was a cool experience. For the study that I participated in, I only had to fill out a survey, but it was still cool!</p>

    <h2>PUBHLT 1001: Introduction to Global Health</h2>
    <p>As someone now studying public health, you may be able to guess that this is one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Pitt. The professor of this class actually wrote one of my recommendation letters for grad school with Pitt Public Health.
    My least favorite part was having to write a group paper (awkward story about texting the girl about how bad her section of the paper was), but these are to be expected.</p>

    <h2>PUBSRV 1455: Law, Ethics, and Public Policy in the Mass Media</h2>
    <p>Technically, this class was required for my major and didn't count as a gen ed. We had an ad-junct professor who was a lawyer and shared lots of stories from her own experience which was very interesting. I didn't realize how little I knew about the United States legal system until I took this class. My section was on Thursday nights, and I missed a football game to go to this class which I am even more sad about now than I was at the time because I miss going to Pitt football games :'(</p>

    <h2>THEA 0830: Introduction to Performance</h2>
    <p>I did theater all throughout high school, so I was very excited to take an Introduction to Performance class at Pitt. We also had, or should I say, <em>got</em> to go to the Pitt productions that semester which was so much fun! I got to see Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, The Wolves, and the musical Next to Normal which made me bawl silently in my front-row seat.</p>

    <h2>PSY 0105: Introduction to Social Psychology</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>CHEM 0120: </h2>
    <div class='spotify-song'>
      <p>Fun fact: I got extra credit for sending this song to my chemistry professor since it was about solubility. She responded saying it was great, but I don't think the point was ever added to my grade. Not like it would have helped anyway, but I spent a while looking for the song! It's now in some of my playlists though, so no real harm was done.</p>
